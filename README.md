**`"What is the fruit of these teachings? Only the most beautiful and proper harvest of the truly educatedâ€”â€”tranquillity, fearlessness, and freedom. We should not trust the masses who say only the free can be educated, but rather the lovers of wisdom who say that only the educated are free." - Epictetus.`**
