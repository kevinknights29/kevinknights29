My journey began in **Electromechanical Engineering**, where my fascination with the AI landscape took root during my final university years. This passion led me to pursue several prestigious AI certifications and training programs from institutions such as **Stanford, Microsoft, and Databricks**. I've also embraced the role of educator and influencer in the AI space, serving as a **Microsoft Certified Trainer** and keynote **speaker** at various conferences. My commitment to mentoring has helped over **100 individuals** advance their careers in AI.

In my current role, I spearhead the deployment of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to harness growth signals from external data sources like news, earnings transcripts, and social media. My work enables the business to make swift, **informed decisions** and create unparalleled customer experiences by leveraging our **AI/ML capabilities**.

*"What is the fruit of these teachings? Only the most beautiful and proper harvest of the truly educatedâ€”â€”tranquillity, fearlessness, and freedom. We should not trust the masses who say only the free can be educated, but rather the lovers of wisdom who say that only the educated are free."* ~ Epictetus.
