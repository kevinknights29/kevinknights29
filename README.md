**`"What is the fruit of these teachings? Only the most beautiful and proper harvest of the truly educated——tranquillity, fearless-ness, and freedom. We should not trust the masses who say only the free can be educated, but rather the lovers of wisdom who say that only the educated are free." - Epictetus.`**

I'm passionate about technology and love to learn new things. My GitHub, is a reflection of the pursuit of exposing myself to new concepts, tools, learnings and challenges to continue to build and refine my skillset in order to drive value and results.

I'm currently a Data Engineer, in charge of building efficient and scalable data pipelines. In the furue, I would like to be a Machine Learning Engineer.
